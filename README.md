# TWIST2018

This project & the website were realized 2018 at the first [TWIST2018](https://twist2018.ch) Hackdays 25/08 & 26/08 as part of the [Swiss Statistics Meeting 2018](https://statistiktage.ch/en/)

It took two good!interesting days where we tried out and used **LOSD & SPARQL** (Linked Open Statistical Data & SPARQL Protocol And RDF Query Language). 

It may be useful for you to do first steps with **LOSD & SPARQL** and get some information about [**Open Data** of the City of Zurich](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/)

List of [SPARQL queries that we used](https://github.com/filippo82/twist2018_linked_data_6/blob/master/queries.md) 

Links to **more resources** you can find on the [about page](https://su-pa.net/twist2018/about.html) of the website.
